# NumberImageProcessing

Second large project in Python!

An attempt to read handwriting images through an algorithm I created myself (which was a brute-force min pixel distance mean), which also included functions to auto scale and shift to try to improve the reading.

Not high quality, but lots of complexity. This was an early coding project.
